Back-end stage:
App title: Calorie Calculator
App description: This app will take inputs of users of their weight, height, age and the place where
they are living in (city and country) to scrape the current temperature information. All of these components will be counted
and give users the results as their needed calories intake of the present day. (we don't focus on user's data
so don't need to create a user class to store user's information)
